# Wks
A **Working Knowledge System** for the industry, companies or organizations.

Wks is an experimental system that try to manage company or oraganization assets and activities in a **single unified framework** of collaborative software modules.

The system goal is to incrementally incorporate and manage assets or activities in the framework in a self-sufficent way, reducing external dependencies and vendor-locks-in as much as possible.

The name **Wks** and the acronim **WKS** are inspired by the fact that assets, activities and knowledge in general should be *absorbed* by the system incrementally and during the normal daily *working* of a company, organization or team.
Without claiming that everything is already know and pre-defined upfront, as we know that normally, each reality is diverse one from each other.

Currently the status of the system is in a early stage, it lives in a development environment on the cloud, and has not yet any real installation is place, but looking for one to get real use-cases to deal with.

# Technologies
Technologies, languages and libraries used in the system are many, different, but open source as much as possible:

- Object Pascal
- ISAPI, SOAP. REST
- MS SQL Server, MongoDb, Redis
- Nats
- HTML, CSS, Javascript
- W3CSS, W3JS, Pico
